###*A simple space shooter game originally intended for mobile devices*

The game's development was started several years ago during a very boring meeting.
The code is still *a prototype* and needs to be and will be refactored.
Fundamental OOP concepts like *loose coupling* where not clear at the time.

The game has been used for several years at **Mediacollege Amsterdam** for promotional purposes.
Aspiring students have been using the game as an introduction into gamedevelopment.
